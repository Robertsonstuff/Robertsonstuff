            <p>I'm a 37 Aussie living in NYC. I have many interests which leaves me always in a steady flow of trying to push forward and move the needle in some aspect of my life.

The feeling of being endlessly fascinated with the many pursuits I have can leave me feeling overwhelmed, but never bored. This disposition of balancing of plates between music, cooking, coding, learning Russian, and fitness keeps my attention. I still have another obsession that is keeping focused on managing my passions in a somewhat OCD manner. Yep, am now logging a simple spreadsheet of all my passions to understand in more detail where my focus is for now, how do I feel about it, where would I prefer to manage my time in the effort to help me keep track of my position and help me course correct.

I'm aware there are arguments for a lack of focus in this approach which is fair to make. I'm actually stress testing this very thought out for myself. My aim is to collect the data for myself, to find out what's suits me best. Why? Many reasons:

More enjoyable

To satisfy my curious nature

Accountability to myself

Know by doing, rather than do by someone else telling me to

Life is long, we have plenty of time to work on everything we want to.

And remember, I'm a nobody, I could be totally wrong here, but either way, I'm curious to find out, and I'll enjoy the process regardless.

I'll let you know how I go üëçüòä

Sending my love to all the people like me who are finding their passions and wanting to be better than yesterday, making their mark in the world.

            <p>My Colleagues said, ‚ÄúHave a great weekend and be sure to come back recharged.‚Äù While this is a sweet idea, coming from the best of intentions, it poses a somewhat faulty expectation that I know how to recharge.

This unfair expectation leads me to the chasm between the idea and the execution; simple to understand, but hard to do.

So, with my best efforts, I have¬†some¬†ideas to help recharge:

Low energy activity; a walk, watching a show you enjoy, talking to a friend.

Usually, if something zaps me of energy, I immediately think of something ‚Äòlow energy‚Äô where I can be do something simple to recover, giving my brain ‚Äòa break‚Äô; going for a walk, watching a show, giving me some space and a mild distraction from what I am doing, allowing some time to process.

Do something you're passionate about; hobby/activity.

This is counterintuitive to my last point. This approach should provide some new found energy, amping you up to launch back into what you need to get back to. Rather than being static, this approach may still require mental or physical energy from you. The act of doing something you enjoy, filling you with satisfaction, spending time with your passions in life, should boost your mood in more ways than you may not even be aware of.

An added bonus will be finding out which of your passions boost your mood more than others. Testing this regularly will tell you what kind of season you will be looking at. You'll find some passions will fuel you more than others, but just go with it. You‚Äôll want to find the energy wherever you can get it.

Write out what's bothering you.

The act of putting your feelings on paper can be therapeutic. I heard a friend once say, ‚ÄúWrite out your problems so you can get on top of your problems.‚Äù It's a simple idea but very useful.

I also find that writing down something I remember can bring clarity on how I ‚Äòactually feel‚Äô. For example; I used to play music professionally and I got to the point where is was bitter at the music industry and the way it sets musicians up to fail. After writing about it for a bit, I realised, instead of being bitter, I was greatful for all the amazing experiences I had. Writing about it totally changed my perspective on my own life.

Go to the gym.

The best way to get out of your head is focus on your body. Thinking about things and roominating about your day or your week is really hard to do when you're trying to lift your chin above a bar with your whole body weight.

Looking after that ‚Äòmeat bag‚Äô of yours is not an option for you, it's a requirement. You only get one body, and if you don't look after it, it's really hard to focus on helping anyone else, when you're not looking after yourself.

Remind yourself of a time you were totally relaxed.

This helps me get perspective when I'm stressed. If I look at myself in a picture when I'm in shorts, on a beach, sipping a cocktail, without a worry in the world. It tells me; it's only a matter of time before I can enjoy a relaxing holiday again, the stressful feeling I have now will pass, without a stressful job, I won't be able to go on holidays in the first place.

Hopefully this helps you recharge on your next long weekend. Look after yourself as best you can, no one else will.

                </div>

            </header>

            <p>Being into 'self-help' is tricky. It's hard to tell your friends or family without them rolling their eyes or giving you a side-eyed look. I've found the best way to tell people you're into self-help is not use words. Use action.

Tweek your habits and lifestyle to serve you better, look at the details and make 1% adjustments each week. Soon you'll be showing your love ones an improved version of you without mentioning who you're influenced by.

For anyone who is struggling to dive in and give self-help a shot. I've listed 5 reasons why I follow this content for close to a decade now, and I don't seem to want to slow down any time soon.

1) Awareness.

I like keeping an eye on any seed of an idea I can implement in my own life; and asking can I use this?

More often than I'd like, I feel like I know less and less about living the good life, and quickly turn to others to hear they have to say.

2) Perspective.

I love hearing the interesting lives people live throughout the world. It broadens my view of what is possible.

I'm fascinated in high-performers think differently; reframing ideas to guide them down a better path.

3) Common traits.

The common through-line for most high performers I've noticed so far are:

- A morning workout to start the day

- The daily practice of writing

- The ability to communicate clearly and think critically.

- Executing at a large scale when others can't or won't.

- The thirst for knowledge never stops. Always reading, and always learning.

4) The craft.

Repetition doesn't mean you'll always get better. Practice doesn't make perfect; you can repeat bad habits and never get better. It's possible to drive a car for a living and be the worst driver in the country. So, if I'm able to be aware of better practices, it puts me in a better place to tweek my habits along the way.

5) Accountability.

Any high performer has a coach. If they think they are going to be in the game a long time. They invest in coaches to help them. Asking for help is a strength not a weakness.

I've found this discovery enlightening and helpful in my life. I find it such a shame there is such a barrier to entry for so many. For anyone who finds these findings interesting, remember; you can start straight away, but don't tell your friends about it, just show them a better you.

            <p>In the beginning; you get your ass into the gym, count those reps, and get the hell out.¬†

We all get excited when we're setting any new goal and we're determind to get shit done. But after a while of being able to crush our goals, week in and week out, we set our sights on the next goal. During this time our imagination runs wild for all kinds of lofty goals. We start to imagine ourselves running Full marathons; without ever running a 5km. Triathlons; without owning a bike. We even start looking at a few local Crossfit gyms because we have proven to ourselves we can do something hard and good for us without someone telling us to do it.¬†

So before we go crazy and book our first marathon date, setting our sights on conquering the world. How about we optimize what we already have. What's that you might ask?!

A solid gym routine. That's it! This IS the recipe for success. It sets you up for the biggest advantage in the future, mentally, physically, spiritually.

Consistency.

It‚Äôs the one thing everyone talks about and I'm glad they do. You'll notice, if you can be consistent in the gym, watch how few other people are consistent.¬†

Forget about changing the world with your next goal and just make sure you hit the gym today, and if this isn't constructive enough for you, and you need something new to implement in your daily routine. Try this:
Feel every rep. You want to feel like you've worked. You want to feel the struggle. Well, you asked for it.¬†

Try slowing down your tempo; pause in the hardest part of your rep, feel the control you gain from slowing down your movements, que that halftime bad-ass dupstep track and enjoy feeling like a superhero. Your body will thank you.

"You struggle; only to condition yourself to want to struggle."

            <p>When I was young; the world was scary, there was so much I didn't know. It made me want to live in my own little
world where it was safer and made more sense to me. I remember being so unhappy in my early 20‚Äôs and feeling unsure of what my path ‚Äòshould be‚Äô.

This feeling of overwhelm left me feeling helpless, it was awful. I knew this was strange for others to see, my mum gently reminded me I was living in the clouds; to which I said, ‚ÄúWhat's so good about the reality?‚Äù

Now I'm older; the world is
still scary, but I‚Äôve now been living 15 years longer. Life has taught me I can look at problems and try and to solve them, but there is no expectation on me to have it ‚Äúall figured out‚Äù. As humans we grow, change, and adapt. Certain things we are once fixated on can simply fall away like sand through finger tips. That's reality.

We can live and learn, chosing the problems we want to solve and living our best life with the hands we were dealt. So the question remains: ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs so good about reality?

Well, we share that same place with the people who chose to live in it. We have reality in common. We can only learn how to navigate it better if we can admit we are here in the first place. Better still: if I solve a problem I‚Äôve been working on for years and show it to the three people who live in my little world, I've helped three people. But if I solve a problem in the real world, I've not only helped a lot more people, I've made ‚Äòreality‚Äô a little easier to bare for the rest of us.

                </div>

            <p>This is attributes to an analogy one of my favorite entrepreneur explains which really made an impression on me recently.

It speaks to a strategy of building anything that matters to you in your life (Yes, it's a juicy one). The goal is whoever builds the pasta tower the highest, wins. Pretty simple right? Now, let's think about your life-span, it covers multiple decades. Most people struggle to plan for anything longer than a year. Imagine for a moment you were able to plan for the next 40 years of your life. Let's take it a step further and imagine you were able to stick to everything you had plannned. What does that look like for you in your life? does it serve your ideas of success and quality of life? are you able to adapt easily when plans don't make sense and break into a new subset of possibility which is just as rewarding.¬†

So how do I do that? I hear you ask: no idea. Also, did you expect you would get an answer from someone like me on a page such as this? hehe, anyway, let's try and unpack this.

The pasta analogy was explained as a parallel you can draw from to illustrate for many people who want to build something to a certain size. Making something a lot of people are able to make results in a crowded market and extremely competitive. Just look at most websites, many people have one of those now, but it doesn't mean anyone who has a website is a millionaire.

Alternatively, what if you were able to build something - not a pasta tower - 3-10 times as big?! Not only would you have less competition, the profits are much larger and you're ultimately playing a game you know you can win. BOOM! you are set up for life.

It's as if your playing the lottery but you're in control. Who wouldn't want to play that game??

This train of thought leaves me with a question I will now pose to you. What can you build better than a lot of people you know? do that! Then, build it 10 times as big. This will be how you can build the highest pasta tower. It's time to win.

            <p>Waking up to get to the gym is hard enough. Suffice to say. I didn't feel great about going to the gym; I felt gross, not well rested, my wife was cuddling me as if to say, "stay here with me." A previous version of me would have stayed in bed for sure. But not this me! 2024 Luke got out of bed, slipped into my gym clothes, plugged my ears with a fresh podcast with a bottle of water in hand, and got my lethargic bag of meat to the gym. There we have it, the battle for the day was won! at least that's what I thought.

I was met with what most people see on a Monday morning at the gym. Everyone had their dose of ‚ÄòMonday optimism,‚Äô freshly washed and matching gym attire on, with their new found (but fleeting) motivation to crush the week and go to the gym. I know, what a nightmare. There was people in the gym.

I don't know about you, but I don't like a gym with tonnes of people, blaring club music, reminding me of my adolescent days of puking up my KFC dinner because I wanted to keep up my drinking prowess with my degenerate mates. No, I like a gym with no one in it so I can use whatever I want, and listen to whatever I want through my headphones. Imagine my disappointment when I found the gym in our building brimming with people. As I looked around the room and noticed everyone using the machines and equipment I would normally go to. I did what any self repecting gym novice would do. I left.

As I walked back to the elevator to head back to the apartment, I looked at the weather for the day on phone. I waited for the elevator to get to me and thought, ‚Äúmaybe I could go for a run, people do that all the time,‚Äù sometimes I do too. By the time the elevator opened it's doors, it was enough time to push the button to the ground floor to start running in beautiful 25¬∞C weather. I was Immediately happy with my decision. As I was running around, I then found a pull-up bar started working on my personal best (10 pull ups in a row at the moment). In between each set I kept thinking, "wow, this is so great to be outside, why haven't I been doing this every week?!"

It goes to show: we are so good at creating our own prisons. We don't need to suffer unnecessarily when trying to do something good for ourselves. We have options to win the day. How are you going to win yours?</p>

    'Know your role.' I'm sure you've heard this in a working environment. We know this concept places importance on getting good at one thing in the efforts to work as a team towards the common goal; you're not exactly going to see a soccer player playing a striker position, and suddenly start putting on some gloves becasue he feels like being a goal keeper. Similarly, you won't see a receptionist casually take a client out for a networking lunch. We can agree that in order to have structure in anything involving people working together, we need to know our role.

In the spirit of this idea, a business (or team) will operate the best when members are working in the same role for a decade so the machine to 'run like clock-work.' Everyone will stay out of everyone elses way, whilst executing in there role at break-neck speed. This is surely the answer to an efficent system.

In your experience, how often have you come across people who stay in the same job for 10 years and don't want to move anywhere else within a company?... not often huh. Yeah, I thought so.

I know for myself, if I owned a busniess, I would want it to run like clock-work, but I‚Äôd also want my employees to be happy with what they are doing, I would want to offer better positions for them to grow into and see them grow over the years professionally.

I know what your asking: can you have both? Well, what would entice you to stay at the same level in a job for a decade?

Maybe good money (100K a year), paid time off (5 weeks a year), a high level of job satisfaction, a fancy christmas party, flexibility to work remotely.. Anything else? How would you tackle training? Particularly, if you had the same role for 10 years, surely you wouldn't need to do much training. You'd know everything back-to-front and inside out. What if you learned about how to run a business? You're title might not change, but your training and learning would never stop. You'd learn how to operate a business from the ground up, growing, and scaling to suit your business. You'd have the security of attaining the skills to run your own business if you were ever fced with this opportunity and wanted to do it for yourself.

I argue there's so much more value in understanding the machine rather than the cog. I haven't heard many people talk about this concept much, but I think this would help with staff retention, job satisfaction, clearer understanding of your current role, whilst operating in one, and it acts as a vehilcle to teach us so much more than any one role could. Yep, I think there's real value in learning the machine.</p>
