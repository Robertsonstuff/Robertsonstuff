            <p>I'm a 37 Aussie living in NYC. I have many interests which leaves me always in a steady flow of trying to push forward and move the needle in some aspect of my life.

The feeling of being endlessly fascinated with the many pursuits I have can leave me feeling overwhelmed, but never bored. This disposition of balancing of plates between music, cooking, coding, learning Russian, and fitness keeps my attention. I still have another obsession that is keeping focused on managing my passions in a somewhat OCD manner. Yep, am now logging a simple spreadsheet of all my passions to understand in more detail where my focus is for now, how do I feel about it, where would I prefer to manage my time in the effort to help me keep track of my position and help me course correct.

I'm aware there are arguments for a lack of focus in this approach which is fair to make. I'm actually stress testing this very thought out for myself. My aim is to collect the data for myself, to find out what's suits me best. Why? Many reasons:

More enjoyable

To satisfy my curious nature

Accountability to myself

Know by doing, rather than do by someone else telling me to

Life is long, we have plenty of time to work on everything we want to.

And remember, I'm a nobody, I could be totally wrong here, but either way, I'm curious to find out, and I'll enjoy the process regardless.

I'll let you know how I go üëçüòä

Sending my love to all the people like me who are finding their passions and wanting to be better than yesterday, making their mark in the world.

            <p>My Colleagues said, ‚ÄúHave a great weekend and be sure to come back recharged.‚Äù While this is a sweet idea, coming from the best of intentions, it poses a somewhat faulty expectation that I know how to recharge.

This unfair expectation leads me to the chasm between the idea and the execution; simple to understand, but hard to do.

So, with my best efforts, I have¬†some¬†ideas to help recharge:

Low energy activity; a walk, watching a show you enjoy, talking to a friend.

Usually, if something zaps me of energy, I immediately think of something ‚Äòlow energy‚Äô where I can be do something simple to recover, giving my brain ‚Äòa break‚Äô; going for a walk, watching a show, giving me some space and a mild distraction from what I am doing, allowing some time to process.

Do something you're passionate about; hobby/activity.

This is counterintuitive to my last point. This approach should provide some new found energy, amping you up to launch back into what you need to get back to. Rather than being static, this approach may still require mental or physical energy from you. The act of doing something you enjoy, filling you with satisfaction, spending time with your passions in life, should boost your mood in more ways than you may not even be aware of.

An added bonus will be finding out which of your passions boost your mood more than others. Testing this regularly will tell you what kind of season you will be looking at. You'll find some passions will fuel you more than others, but just go with it. You‚Äôll want to find the energy wherever you can get it.

Write out what's bothering you.

The act of putting your feelings on paper can be therapeutic. I heard a friend once say, ‚ÄúWrite out your problems so you can get on top of your problems.‚Äù It's a simple idea but very useful.

I also find that writing down something I remember can bring clarity on how I ‚Äòactually feel‚Äô. For example; I used to play music professionally and I got to the point where is was bitter at the music industry and the way it sets musicians up to fail. After writing about it for a bit, I realised, instead of being bitter, I was greatful for all the amazing experiences I had. Writing about it totally changed my perspective on my own life.

Go to the gym.

The best way to get out of your head is focus on your body. Thinking about things and roominating about your day or your week is really hard to do when you're trying to lift your chin above a bar with your whole body weight.

Looking after that ‚Äòmeat bag‚Äô of yours is not an option for you, it's a requirement. You only get one body, and if you don't look after it, it's really hard to focus on helping anyone else, when you're not looking after yourself.

Remind yourself of a time you were totally relaxed.

This helps me get perspective when I'm stressed. If I look at myself in a picture when I'm in shorts, on a beach, sipping a cocktail, without a worry in the world. It tells me; it's only a matter of time before I can enjoy a relaxing holiday again, the stressful feeling I have now will pass, without a stressful job, I won't be able to go on holidays in the first place.

Hopefully this helps you recharge on your next long weekend. Look after yourself as best you can, no one else will.

                    <p>Woo woo' or a genuine drive to be better</p>

                </div>

                <div class="meta">

                    <time class="published" datetime="March 02, 2024">March 02, 2024</time>

            <img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt=""></a>

            <p>Being into 'self-help' is tricky. It's hard to tell your friends or family without them rolling their eyes or giving you a side-eyed look. I've found the best way to tell people you're into self-help is not use words. Use action.

Tweek your habits and lifestyle to serve you better, look at the details and make 1% adjustments each week. Soon you'll be showing your love ones an improved version of you without mentioning who you're influenced by.

For anyone who is struggling to dive in and give self-help a shot. I've listed 5 reasons why I follow this content for close to a decade now, and I don't seem to want to slow down any time soon.

1) Awareness.

I like keeping an eye on any seed of an idea I can implement in my own life; and asking can I use this?

More often than I'd like, I feel like I know less and less about living the good life, and quickly turn to others to hear they have to say.

2) Perspective.

I love hearing the interesting lives people live throughout the world. It broadens my view of what is possible.

I'm fascinated in high-performers think differently; reframing ideas to guide them down a better path.

3) Common traits.

The common through-line for most high performers I've noticed so far are:

- A morning workout to start the day

- The daily practice of writing

- The ability to communicate clearly and think critically.

- Executing at a large scale when others can't or won't.

- The thirst for knowledge never stops. Always reading, and always learning.

4) The craft.

Repetition doesn't mean you'll always get better. Practice doesn't make perfect; you can repeat bad habits and never get better. It's possible to drive a car for a living and be the worst driver in the country. So, if I'm able to be aware of better practices, it puts me in a better place to tweek my habits along the way.

5) Accountability.

Any high performer has a coach. If they think they are going to be in the game a long time. They invest in coaches to help them. Asking for help is a strength not a weakness.

I've found this discovery enlightening and helpful in my life. I find it such a shame there is such a barrier to entry for so many. For anyone who finds these findings interesting, remember; you can start straight away, but don't tell your friends about it, just show them a better you.

            <p>In the beginning; you get your ass into the gym, count those reps, and get the hell out.¬†

We all get excited when we're setting any new goal and we're determind to get shit done. But after a while of being able to crush our goals, week in and week out, we set our sights on the next goal. During this time our imagination runs wild for all kinds of lofty goals. We start to imagine ourselves running Full marathons; without ever running a 5km. Triathlons; without owning a bike. We even start looking at a few local Crossfit gyms because we have proven to ourselves we can do something hard and good for us without someone telling us to do it.¬†

So before we go crazy and book our first marathon date, setting our sights on conquering the world. How about we optimize what we already have. What's that you might ask?!

A solid gym routine. That's it! This IS the recipe for success. It sets you up for the biggest advantage in the future, mentally, physically, spiritually.

Consistency.

It‚Äôs the one thing everyone talks about and I'm glad they do. You'll notice, if you can be consistent in the gym, watch how few other people are consistent.¬†

Forget about changing the world with your next goal and just make sure you hit the gym today, and if this isn't constructive enough for you, and you need something new to implement in your daily routine. Try this:
Feel every rep. You want to feel like you've worked. You want to feel the struggle. Well, you asked for it.¬†

Try slowing down your tempo; pause in the hardest part of your rep, feel the control you gain from slowing down your movements, que that halftime bad-ass dupstep track and enjoy feeling like a superhero. Your body will thank you.

"You struggle; only to condition yourself to want to struggle."

            <p>When I was young; the world was scary, there was so much I didn't know. It made me want to live in my own little
world where it was safer and made more sense to me. I remember being so unhappy in my early 20‚Äôs and feeling unsure of what my path ‚Äòshould be‚Äô.

This feeling of overwhelm left me feeling helpless, it was awful. I knew this was strange for others to see, my mum gently reminded me I was living in the clouds; to which I said, ‚ÄúWhat's so good about the reality?‚Äù

Now I'm older; the world is
still scary, but I‚Äôve now been living 15 years longer. Life has taught me I can look at problems and try and to solve them, but there is no expectation on me to have it ‚Äúall figured out‚Äù. As humans we grow, change, and adapt. Certain things we are once fixated on can simply fall away like sand through finger tips. That's reality.

We can live and learn, chosing the problems we want to solve and living our best life with the hands we were dealt. So the question remains: ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs so good about reality?

Well, we share that same place with the people who chose to live in it. We have reality in common. We can only learn how to navigate it better if we can admit we are here in the first place. Better still: if I solve a problem I‚Äôve been working on for years and show it to the three people who live in my little world, I've helped three people. But if I solve a problem in the real world, I've not only helped a lot more people, I've made ‚Äòreality‚Äô a little easier to bare for the rest of us.

                    <h2>Pasta Tower</a></h2>

                    <p>A tribute to Alex Hormozi's analogy</p>

                    <time class="published" datetime="May 31, 2024">May 31, 2024</time>

            <img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt=""></a>

            <p>This is attributes to an analogy one of my favorite entrepreneur explains which really made an impression on me recently.

It speaks to a strategy of building anything that matters to you in your life (Yes, it's a juicy one). The goal is whoever builds the pasta tower the highest, wins. Pretty simple right? Now, let's think about your life-span, it covers multiple decades. Most people struggle to plan for anything longer than a year. Imagine for a moment you were able to plan for the next 40 years of your life. Let's take it a step further and imagine you were able to stick to everything you had plannned. What does that look like for you in your life? does it serve your ideas of success and quality of life? are you able to adapt easily when plans don't make sense and break into a new subset of possibility which is just as rewarding.¬†

So how do I do that? I hear you ask: no idea. Also, did you expect you would get an answer from someone like me on a page such as this? hehe, anyway, let's try and unpack this.

The pasta analogy was explained as a parallel you can draw from to illustrate for many people who want to build something to a certain size. Making something a lot of people are able to make results in a crowded market and extremely competitive. Just look at most websites, many people have one of those now, but it doesn't mean anyone who has a website is a millionaire.

Alternatively, what if you were able to build something - not a pasta tower - 3-10 times as big?! Not only would you have less competition, the profits are much larger and you're ultimately playing a game you know you can win. BOOM! you are set up for life.

It's as if your playing the lottery but you're in control. Who wouldn't want to play that game??

This train of thought leaves me with a question I will now pose to you. What can you build better than a lot of people you know? do that! Then, build it 10 times as big. This will be how you can build the highest pasta tower. It's time to win.

            <p>I've never understood the fascination with wanting to be famous. If you‚Äôre not good at something useful to begin with, why would you want to be famous? Sure, there's the assumption you will be rich and have endless opportunity at every waking second. But that's not what I'm talking about here. Let me explain.

I think if you ask most people, they want their 5 minutes of fame. Being famous is alikened to winning the lottery. I guess there is the assumption being famous allows you to be invited to the parties of the top 1%, entries to the VVIP rooms, names on lists, and offers to opportunites which very few people get. Sure, there is that. That souns kinda great. But there is something else to consider here, like; walking into a cafe, ordering a coffee and enjoying not being interrupted by anything (other than the waiter). What about that?? are you sold yet?? ok, one more thing.

Imagine a scenario where everyone knows your name, you are often stopped to take photos with strangers, they assume you are rich in cash and opportunity. But the truth is: you're rich in stardom, but not in cash. Yes, that exists too. Imagine you can't get a ‚Äòreal job‚Äô as your celebrity persona over shadows anything you try to do, there's an expectation for you to attend the parties, donate to charities, but you know you can't. Does that sound like fun to you?

For some reason, this picture of a ‚ÄòD grade celebrity' scenario is what I think of when it comes to ‚Äòfame'. I'm sure this is not what comes to mind for most, but I find it useful. It forces me to make sure I prove to myself I have something to offer the world in a tangable sense. Meaning: I want to make sure I'm uselful to myself and others; skills, talents. Afterall, we live in a world where Gold medal olympians are forced to find ‚Äònormal jobs‚Äô to pay the bills, and entertaining the thought of selling their gold medal to help set up their life a little. The sad thing is, this is more common than you might think. One story comes to mind of a gold medalist in Greco-Roman wrestling ended up working as a ‚Äògreeter‚Äô at a sporting goods store. Yeeesh!

My preference is to try to move towards being good rather than being known. Which poses the question, what do you we need to be good at to be useful? In the case of the olympian, if you spend 10 years learning how to jump the highest in the world, you may not be suited to be a managing partner at a law firm.

Now, I‚Äôm not going to pretend like I have all the answers here, rattle off a list of skills I think everyone needs to be good at, making sure they are heading down the path with the most options. At this point I'd rather point back to the school days. What were the classics? Reading, writing, arithmetic? That sounds fair right? Now think about the average adult. Are they doing these things often? and If they are, are they any good at it? Remember; you can drive for a living, but still be the worst driver in the country. So it just might be time to sharpen up that pencil of yours and try to get good. What are you reading? What are you writing? How's your simple math skills?

Are you getting good?
