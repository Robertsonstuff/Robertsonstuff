I don't think we celebrate the idea of those inbetween stages enough. I would love to live in a world where an aspiring artist signals you are infact heading in a noble direction and it was celebrated. We are more likely to imagine a disheveled person ‘pedalling their wears’ next to a homeless guy. I may also want to live in this ideal world from a bias view as this is where I am at the moment. An aspiring artist, aspiring writer/thinker, aspiring performer, aspiring lifestyle entreprenuer, aspiring fitness guy and working IT professional. Yeah, I may want to rethink how to word that, but the direction feels right. Anyway. Artists! Most of my friends are musicians. I seem to collect people who are creative in some way and work professionally in their field in some capacity to keep their love alive, as do I. As I think about this group of friends, I wouldn't say they are artists. In my mind, musicians can be technicians; performers, teachers, practicioners, clinicians, scholars, artists, and a mix of all of the above. Being an artist is interesting to me. It holds two extremes of the intrinsically gifted, to the more well known struggling lifestyle choice. For the most part, it's not exactly glamorous to be an artist. It's easier to imagine someone unkempt, disheveled, and slightly detached from reality, than a genius who can capture a life altering feeling or idea in a truely unique way. Until an artist creates something which captures the world and importalizes them forever, they can just keep selling artwork on the street next to the homeless guy. Painfully, there are a lot of parallels between this idea and what I experienced working as a musician for years, and beyond that, there aren't a lot of sexy examples of artists in the world today. I guess musicians are more commonally referred to as artists than in other fields - depending on your circle of friends and if you're living in a western culture like myself - Let’s face it, hyperthetically, if you were a parent and your child said they wanted to be an artist, tell me you wouldn't try to talk them out of it, because most of us flash forward in a practical sense and think of how they will pay their bills. It's a negative outlook, but also realistic right? What I'm more interested in exploring is the power an artist can weild. If an actor has a performance in a movie which is celebrated by the world, the actor would be described as ‘an artist.’ If an athlete displays a feet of mastery, they are considered ‘an artist.’ Artists can be celebrated for centuries in musuems around the world. If a musician writes a song which is their own, they are considered ‘an artists.’ If an artist creates something beautiful and no one else finds it, they are still an artist, they just have a poor marketing plan. But if they are exceptional at something and the masses know about them, artisits can start movements, change cultures, and inspire artistry for others. In saying all this, I hope to take another thoughtful look at the ‘aspiring artist’ camp to posit the idea: positioning oneself to be more likely to change culture, start movements, etc, surely has to be worth more than never trying. I vote there is value in creating more of what love to do, getting good at it, seeing what you're made of, actually going for it, and even if you fall short and you're not a artist, you're in a better position than looking at the world of have's and have-nots. I’d rather be an aspiring artist than never trying, even with all the negative connotations I've mentioned. Shoot for the moon and stuff you know! Anyway, you get the gist. I'm going to stop talking now.
