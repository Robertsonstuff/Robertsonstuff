                <p>'Know your role.' I'm sure you've heard this in a working environment. We know this concept places importance on getting good at one thing in the efforts to work as a team towards the common goal; you're not exactly going to see a soccer player playing a striker position, and suddenly start putting on some gloves becasue he feels like being a goal keeper. Similarly, you won't see a receptionist casually take a client out for a networking lunch. We can agree that in order to have structure in anything involving people working together, we need to know our role.

In the spirit of this idea, a business (or team) will operate the best when members are working in the same role for a decade so the machine to 'run like clock-work.' Everyone will stay out of everyone elses way, whilst executing in there role at break-neck speed. This is surely the answer to an efficent system.

In your experience, how often have you come across people who stay in the same job for 10 years and don't want to move anywhere else within a company?... not often huh. Yeah, I thought so.

I know for myself, if I owned a busniess, I would want it to run like clock-work, but Iâ€™d also want my employees to be happy with what they are doing, I would want to offer better positions for them to grow into and see them grow over the years professionally.

I know what your asking: can you have both? Well, what would entice you to stay at the same level in a job for a decade?

Maybe good money (100K a year), paid time off (5 weeks a year), a high level of job satisfaction, a fancy christmas party, flexibility to work remotely.. Anything else? How would you tackle training? Particularly, if you had the same role for 10 years, surely you wouldn't need to do much training. You'd know everything back-to-front and inside out. What if you learned about how to run a business? You're title might not change, but your training and learning would never stop. You'd learn how to operate a business from the ground up, growing, and scaling to suit your business. You'd have the security of attaining the skills to run your own business if you were ever fced with this opportunity and wanted to do it for yourself.

I argue there's so much more value in understanding the machine rather than the cog. I haven't heard many people talk about this concept much, but I think this would help with staff retention, job satisfaction, clearer understanding of your current role, whilst operating in one, and it acts as a vehilcle to teach us so much more than any one role could. Yep, I think there's real value in learning the machine.
