	  It's very easy for us to react to things happening in our lives. We save some money to travel. We find some food because we are hungry. We go to the doctor when we don't feel well. There is a reason for doing what we are doing and it requires no brain power to find a solution to the problem.

Now if we look at a similar prolem like: feeling tired. Usually we end up crashing on the couch to solve the problem. The idea being: we are needing to take a mental and physical break in order to feel refreshed. Perfrectly logical so far right? My next question is, how long do we do normally park our ass on the couch for?

I grew up in a household where my parents would work their 8 hours, they come home, make dinner, then sit infront of the T.V. for the rest of the night. That's an average of 2 hours per night, 5 days a week. Then we have the weekend. Surely after working 40 hours a week buys us some time to watch some T.V. on the weekend, so let's double it on the weekends. That's a total of 18 hours of T.V. at a minimum! That’s a lot of rest!

This little snapshot is common. It indicates something which seems logical, but our reaction is illogical. Surely we don't need to waste a whole day (nearly) every week to recover from something so mundane like work.

There are many ways to recover from work, but for some reason, it's so easy to go back to what we know, assume the position, and let the binge begin!

If you're looking for ways to recover without wasting so much time. Here’s simple ideas you can try, all of which I've tried and tested:

Limit your T.V./YouTube time

Something active: Hit the gym, a walk, kick a soccer ball around.

15 minutes minimum of doing a hobby of yours

Journal

If you manage to try just limiting your T.V. time to one show or an hour, try to pay attention to how you feel after that hour. Ask yourself, “do you feel rested?” if you don’t feel rested, it's not working, and trying another hour will not work either. Trust me.

The concept of doing less to feel rested makes sense. But doing things can give you energy. It comes back to a logical reasoning with what seems like an illogical answer. Try something for me; next time you find yourself crashing on the couch, give yourself a time limit. Once that time limit is up, pay attention to how you feel, the data is helpful, take note of what ‘resting’ did for you, because no one can afford to waste so much time resting.
