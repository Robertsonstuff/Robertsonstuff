                <p>This is attributes to an analogy one of my favorite entrepreneur explains which really made an impression on me recently.

It speaks to a strategy of building anything that matters to you in your life (Yes, it's a juicy one). The goal is whoever builds the pasta tower the highest, wins. Pretty simple right? Now, let's think about your life-span, it covers multiple decades. Most people struggle to plan for anything longer than a year. Imagine for a moment you were able to plan for the next 40 years of your life. Let's take it a step further and imagine you were able to stick to everything you had plannned. What does that look like for you in your life? does it serve your ideas of success and quality of life? are you able to adapt easily when plans don't make sense and break into a new subset of possibility which is just as rewarding.Â 

So how do I do that? I hear you ask: no idea. Also, did you expect you would get an answer from someone like me on a page such as this? hehe, anyway, let's try and unpack this.

The pasta analogy was explained as a parallel you can draw from to illustrate for many people who want to build something to a certain size. Making something a lot of people are able to make results in a crowded market and extremely competitive. Just look at most websites, many people have one of those now, but it doesn't mean anyone who has a website is a millionaire.

Alternatively, what if you were able to build something - not a pasta tower - 3-10 times as big?! Not only would you have less competition, the profits are much larger and you're ultimately playing a game you know you can win. BOOM! you are set up for life.

It's as if your playing the lottery but you're in control. Who wouldn't want to play that game??

This train of thought leaves me with a question I will now pose to you. What can you build better than a lot of people you know? do that! Then, build it 10 times as big. This will be how you can build the highest pasta tower. It's time to win.</p>
