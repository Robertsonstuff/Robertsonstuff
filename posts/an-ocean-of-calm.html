	<p>In my 20's I regularly drove down to the beach to take in the view of the ocean and marvel at it. I'd walk along the esplanade and instantly feel better, gaining perspective and realizing many things about life like:

The ocean doesn't give a fuck about me

There many things bigger than me and my tiny problems

My inability to truely understand how vast the ocean is

The permanents of the ocean and the impermanants of me

I used to think I was a special little snowflake when I found out walking by the beach  made me feel good. As it turns out, it's the same for most people. In fact, there is a scientific reason why people gravitate towards the water. Apparently, exposure to large bodies of water are rich in what is called: negative ions. These little ions (unable to be seen by the naked eye) are believed to have mood-enhancing and stress-reducing effects, increasing our levels of serotonin (a ‘feel-good’ neurotransmitter). 

So how do these ions work? do we get the same effect from a fish tank or a glass of water on the table? studies at this stage don't prove this effectively. It's more likely to effect humans who are exposed to large, moving bodies of water, like a waterfall or a beach. This isn't to say a large pond doesn't contain negative ions, it's just less than a moving body of water. So what do these little ions do for us? check this out:

Reduces inflammation, anxiety, airbourne allergens, pollutants, and stress

Boosts a production of white blood cells, ammune system and antibodies

Regulates your mood and emotions

Boosts sleep quality and levels of calm

Yeah, I know right!? Ions, what don't they do!!  But if you're landlocked and are wanting some of that feel-good energy to add to your lifestyle, I've got you covered. 

Here are more ways to boost your serotonin levels:

Broadly
<ul>
<li>Exercise</li>
<li>Meditation</li>
<li>Clean Diet</li>
<li>Natural sunlight</li>
</ul>
More specifically
<ul>
<li>Fish oils</li>
<li>Vitamin B, C, and magnesium</li>
<li>Spend time with loved ones (or any positive social interation)</li>
<li>Milk, fish, whole grains, seeds, and nuts</li>
<li>Caffeinated drinks</li>
</ul>

So there ya go, Even if we all can't walk by the beach when we want to, we can use these tools to get the same effect, boosting those feel good vibes in our life.
