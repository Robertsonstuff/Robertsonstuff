					Waking up to get to the gym is hard enough. Suffice to say. I didn't feel great about going to the gym; I felt gross, not well rested, my wife was cuddling me as if to say, "stay here with me." A previous version of me would have stayed in bed for sure. But not this me! 2024 Luke got out of bed, slipped into my gym clothes, plugged my ears with a fresh podcast with a bottle of water in hand, and got my lethargic bag of meat to the gym. There we have it, the battle for the day was won! at least that's what I thought.

I was met with what most people see on a Monday morning at the gym. Everyone had their dose of ‘Monday optimism,’ freshly washed and matching gym attire on, with their new found (but fleeting) motivation to crush the week and go to the gym. I know, what a nightmare. There was people in the gym.

I don't know about you, but I don't like a gym with tonnes of people, blaring club music, reminding me of my adolescent days of puking up my KFC dinner because I wanted to keep up my drinking prowess with my degenerate mates. No, I like a gym with no one in it so I can use whatever I want, and listen to whatever I want through my headphones. Imagine my disappointment when I found the gym in our building brimming with people. As I looked around the room and noticed everyone using the machines and equipment I would normally go to. I did what any self repecting gym novice would do. I left.

As I walked back to the elevator to head back to the apartment, I looked at the weather for the day on phone. I waited for the elevator to get to me and thought, “maybe I could go for a run, people do that all the time,” sometimes I do too. By the time the elevator opened it's doors, it was enough time to push the button to the ground floor to start running in beautiful 25°C weather. I was Immediately happy with my decision. As I was running around, I then found a pull-up bar started working on my personal best (10 pull ups in a row at the moment). In between each set I kept thinking, "wow, this is so great to be outside, why haven't I been doing this every week?!"

It goes to show: we are so good at creating our own prisons. We don't need to suffer unnecessarily when trying to do something good for ourselves. We have options to win the day. How are you going to win yours?
