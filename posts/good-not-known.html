I've never understood the fascination with wanting to be famous. If you’re not good at something useful to begin with, why would you want to be famous? Sure, there's the assumption you will be rich and have endless opportunity at every waking second. But that's not what I'm talking about here. Let me explain. I think if you ask most people, they want their 5 minutes of fame. Being famous is alikened to winning the lottery. I guess there is the assumption being famous allows you to be invited to the parties of the top 1%, entries to the VVIP rooms, names on lists, and offers to opportunites which very few people get. Sure, there is that. That souns kinda great. But there is something else to consider here, like; walking into a cafe, ordering a coffee and enjoying not being interrupted by anything (other than the waiter). What about that?? are you sold yet?? ok, one more thing. Imagine a scenario where everyone knows your name, you are often stopped to take photos with strangers, they assume you are rich in cash and opportunity. But the truth is: you're rich in stardom, but not in cash. Yes, that exists too. Imagine you can't get a ‘real job’ as your celebrity persona over shadows anything you try to do, there's an expectation for you to attend the parties, donate to charities, but you know you can't. Does that sound like fun to you? For some reason, this picture of a ‘D grade celebrity' scenario is what I think of when it comes to ‘fame'. I'm sure this is not what comes to mind for most, but I find it useful. It forces me to make sure I prove to myself I have something to offer the world in a tangable sense. Meaning: I want to make sure I'm uselful to myself and others; skills, talents. Afterall, we live in a world where Gold medal olympians are forced to find ‘normal jobs’ to pay the bills, and entertaining the thought of selling their gold medal to help set up their life a little. The sad thing is, this is more common than you might think. One story comes to mind of a gold medalist in Greco-Roman wrestling ended up working as a ‘greeter’ at a sporting goods store. Yeeesh! My preference is to try to move towards being good rather than being known. Which poses the question, what do you we need to be good at to be useful? In the case of the olympian, if you spend 10 years learning how to jump the highest in the world, you may not be suited to be a managing partner at a law firm. Now, I’m not going to pretend like I have all the answers here, rattle off a list of skills I think everyone needs to be good at, making sure they are heading down the path with the most options. At this point I'd rather point back to the school days. What were the classics? Reading, writing, arithmetic? That sounds fair right? Now think about the average adult. Are they doing these things often? and If they are, are they any good at it? Remember; you can drive for a living, but still be the worst driver in the country. So it just might be time to sharpen up that pencil of yours and try to get good. What are you reading? What are you writing? How's your simple math skills? Are you getting good?
