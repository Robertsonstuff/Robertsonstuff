            <p>Whether you’re into fitness, music, coding, or cooking, and you want to get better at it and see some progress, you’ll likely experience the same thing as me. I’ve been consistently hitting the gym for almost a year now and I'm blown away by how different it feels to workout compared to where I started.

In the beginning; I woke up 30 minutes earlier than I needed to, I’d slide out of bed and into some daggy clothes, zombie-walk down to the basement, lift some weights, count the reps, and get the hell out of there. Some would call this going through the motions, but I was using whatever I had in me to start the habit. What I wasn’t counting on was what happened next.

I’d continue to get up each morning for months to hit the gym, only to feel this lack of satisfaction. I would get to the end of my workout, and be ready to fall back asleep. It was such a strange feeling. On the plus side, all these positive things were happening; the excitement for the gym session the night before, seeing the weight go up each week, and seeing the body weight and waistline come down as I tracked my progress in what I affectionately call my ‘serial killer spreadsheet.’ For some reason, it wasn’t enough. Yep, I said it. Everything I wanted to accomplish was happening. I was seeing progress, and yet: I wanted to feel more of a struggle.

This realization scares me, as it leads itself down some dark roads. Why do I want to make things harder when they don’t need to be? Just because I wasn’t feeling a certain way, I wasn’t happy with the result, even though, the result was progress. So where do we go from here? Is this something baked into my psychology? Am I doomed forever? Or does going to the gym specifically strengthen this particular ‘mental muscle’ to want to make things harder, finding more challenges as we exercise for longer periods?

I struggled in the beginning to get to a point where it became automatic, only to find myself conditioned to the stage now where I want to struggle again.

Where does this lead me if I keep going down this track? Is it inevitable I will end up a jacked dude who won’t ever feel jacked enough? Is it possible to feel like I’ve done enough in the gym? does this translate to other things in my life? when will it end?!

*sigh*
