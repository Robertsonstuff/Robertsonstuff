            <p>There are countless articles, ads, videos, blogs / social media posts about doing all this cool stuff in the world; running a marathon, earning a million dollars, getting a six-pack, writing a book, owning your own business, earning passive income in ‘x’ amount of days. I've clicked on enough click-bait articles to know this first hand, they are so easy to find and they’re everywhere!

If you've been down these rabbit holes before (like I have), you'll know it takes some filtering to find reputable content, but once you find them, you'll now know all the information you'll ever need, but no matter what you pick, you'll soon find out: knowing what to do is the easy part. Doing the work is hard, doing the work and being patient while you see no results for years is super hard. No matter what hill you’re climbing, they all seem incredibly steep, with no end in sight, and the path won't be recognizable until it's under your feet. So, how do we know we’re climbing the right hill? What if all of our time is wasted in our pursuit? Will we just have to start again from scratch?

Don't worry, I've been here many times before. I know from experience if we keep changing hills everytime we feel uncertain, we'll never reach any great height, nevermind reaching the top, but you will get really good at quiting when things get hard!

Let me ask you this: What do people do when they feel like they are playing a zero sum game? … they complain. Have you ever noticed how often people complain? A lot right? This might open your eyes to the kind of people you spend your time with.

So what's the solution here? Well, in my humble opinion, the only thing that makes sense to me which inspires me to keep climbing is:

Read the articles which interest you, and if you hear a seemingly good idea, test it yourself.

Treat information from ‘experts’ with some skeptism.

Track your progress to remind yourself of your progress (you'll forget and get discouraged otherwise).

Share your process out loud on social media (to find like-minded friends to lean on)

Don't quit, there are too many people in the world quitting on their dreams.

More on this last point. And this is just me here but I'd rather be known as someone who managed to reach their dream at age 60, than give up at age 30, and never have a chance because I'm a “realist.” Consider this: Think about having a problem for 30 years, do you think you have enough time to solve it!?

Patience is the game here, you don't have to solve your problem straight away, you have time, just keep climbing. As you go through different seasons in your life, you'll be able to move quicker in some seasons compared to others. Your environment plays a huge factor in operating at your best. A good friend of mine once explained this idea in a metaphor which has stuck with me for years, he said, “It's as if you want to fly a kite all the time because it makes you feel amazing, you're also very good at it. There's nothing wrong with doing what you love and you shouldn't feel bad for wanting to fly your kite all the time. But please be careful, sometimes you don't realize you're standing under powerlines.”</p>
