My mother always used to say, “if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it at all.” It also made sense why my mother was always so quiet around family occasions, but that's a story for another time. I recently caught up with some old friends who would tell us all these stories about why something was shit, or it didn't work out for them. They would then nervously laugh after their story to signal they were forcing this experience into something they now find funny, as if to say they have perspective on the situation. I began to think they were having a bad time lately and wanted to be a good friend and hear them out. Over the next few days, no matter what experience we had, there was always something crappy they wanted to point out and then forcefully laugh about it, as if it was helpful or some version of an undercooked comedic bit. This wore thin with me pretty quickly. I kept trying to understand what was so fascinating with calling things out which aren't as they should be. Were they surprised things weren't perfect? Were they trying to display to us they were observant? Were they intrinsically negative people and it was just oozing out of their mouth? It almost fascinated me, but ya know, didn't (for obvious reasons). Who knows, maybe I'm missing the point. Maybe they were just being real; we were on holiday, and they weren't having a great time. They were sharing what they were experiencing expecting us to agree, only: we were having a great time. Being reminded of every little thing which didn't measure up to their standards wasn’t ruining our day, but it wasn't making it better. I understand the need to vent with the people you trust, but if all of your stories end with a criticizism of what you've experienced, no one benefits. While I try to learn something from our friends behaviour. I don't yet see the benefit in them acting the way they did. The question still remains: is complaining useful?
